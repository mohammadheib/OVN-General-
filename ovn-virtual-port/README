this script will create two ovn virtual ports one with vip ipv4 and the second with 
ipv6.

the two ports will be created and with link status down and chassis column will 
be empty.

in order to bind those ports to VIF ports you must send ARP/ND packet with the
VIP as target from one of the  VIF (use scapy for ARP).
	
      From the VIF parent port continer/vm run scapy and send on of the following pkt:

	""" send(ARP(op=1, psrc=vip, pdst=vip)) """
	""" send(ARP(op=2, psrc=vip, pdst=anyip)) """

This will bind the virtual port to the the VIF chassis and apply all the ovs
lflows belongs to the vrtual port on the chassis Datapath.


For IPV6 port binding use scapy with ICMPv6:

	"""scapy"""
		from scapy.layers.inet6 import *
		neighsol('2001:db8::f816:3eff:fe9b:61d1', '1000::3', 'sw0p1')
